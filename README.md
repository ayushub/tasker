Coding Project Outline

This project is designed to test a candidate’s programming skills, in particular their ability to create well-structured and organized code.

Project Background

The project mirrors the capabilities of the Trello task management tool. For those unfamiliar with it, Trello is a free web-based service that lets teams structure tasks and assignments in a very flexible way, with an easy to use and intuitive front end written in HTML5.

Trello consists of the following constructs:
Boards, which can contain zero to many Lists
Lists, which can contain zero to many Cards
Cards, which have a mandatory Title and can include a number of optional parameters, including: Description, Due Date, Label and Members
Members, which can be assigned to a card -- in the image above, Andrew Dowling has been assigned to the card titled Task 3
Each Board can have up to six Labels which can be named according to the Board (e.g. High Priority, Medium Priority, Low Priority) and assigned to each Card

Actions which can be performed on each item include:
Boards can be created, renamed and archived
Lists can be created, archived, renamed and reordered
Cards can be created, archived, renamed, reordered within a list, or moved to another list
Members can be created, renamed, archived and assigned to cards
Labels can be renamed and assigned to cards. Each card can only have one label

Project Description

We are not asking you to reproduce the user experience of using Trello, as this is clearly a very large task. We are however asking you to create a program which models the behavior of the system. Key points about this project include:

You may choose from one of the following languages: Java, C++, Python, C#, or Ruby however everything else is up to you.
We don’t expect an elaborate user interface for the project, in fact it’s OK for this to be a command-line interface if that makes things easier for you.
We do expect an external user to be able to interact with the system and perform all the actions described above
The end solution is to be hosted on a publicly accessible server for us to test. If not, the project must contain clear steps on how to get the system setup on our local machines.
All code must be committed to a VCS and hosted on either Github or Bitbucket.
We are primarily concerned with the way you structure and organise your code, although obviously anything which goes beyond the bare minimum in terms of functionality is likely to reflect positively in our assessment
